  <h1> What Forms a Form? </h1>
	  <img class="img" src="uber_eats.jpg"/>
	  <p> One home screen I am quite familiar with. I like the simplicity of adding my delivery address and the algorithm selects takeout places within my delivery area. I get to choose what kind of food I’m interested in eating right now. The website tracks your Internet-use with cookies. If you allow them, they offer promotions and location-based services.  </p>

	  <p> On the Nike website after a few minutes of viewing, a pop-up screen prompts for me to sign up for their mailings including exclusives. I like that it asks for my shopping preferences so it tailors the special offers to my preferences, seizing on every opportunity to mine userdata. At least it doesn't have the pop-up to make me accept cookies, to add insult to injury lol.</p>

	  <img class="img" src="amazon.png"/>
	  <p> Another screen I am familiar with, the Amazon return screen. Again, simple to use, with minimal text fields. The drop down menu for the reason why I am returning the product is big enough it covers most situations. Rarely, I am not able to return an item if I am within the timeframe for allowable returns. </p>

	  <p> Wow that’s easy. All they want to know is if I want digital or print and then ask for payment. Seems like they don’t care at all about who their readers are. They don't give an option for you to set up a profile page or ask for your preferences to mail daily digests.</p>

	  <img class="img" src="pen_pal.png"/>
	  <p> A student in my neighborhood is completing a leadership capstone project and developed a platform to connect people in self-isolation through letter-writing. To join the pen pal club you have to fill out a member profile. I like how the profile asks both multiple choice and very generalized narrative questions. You basically can write anything you want. To join there are important site rules, like an important privacy clause, that you need to pledge to. I like the soothing yellow background and unbolded unthreatening font. </p>
	  <hr>
	  
	  <img class="img" src="facebook.png"/>
	  <p> The iconic Facebook login. Your birthday is used as personal identifiable information (PII). You can't use the site until you go through their form. You're require to either log into your existing account, or create a new one and set up a page. No way around this.</p>
