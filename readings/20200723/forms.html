  <h1> What Forms a Form? </h1>

	  <p> One home screen I am quite familiar with. I like the simplicity of adding my delivery address and the algorithm selects takeout places within my delivery area. I get to choose what kind of food I’m interested in eating right now. </p>

	  <p> On the Nike website after a few minutes of viewing, a pop-up screen prompts for me to sign up for their mailings including exclusives. I like that it asks for my shopping preferences so it tailors the special offers to my preferences, seizing on every opportunity to mine userdata. At least it doesn't have the pop-up to make me accept cookies, to add insult to injury lol.</p>

	  <img class="img" src="amazon.png"/>
	  <p> Another screen I am familiar with, the Amazon return screen. Again, simple to use, with minimal text fields. The drop down menu for the reason why I am returning the product is big enough it covers most situations. Rarely, I am not able to return an item if I am within the timeframe for allowable returns. </p>

	  <p> Wow that’s easy. All they want to know is if I want digital or print and then ask for payment. Seems like they don’t care at all about who their readers are. </p>
