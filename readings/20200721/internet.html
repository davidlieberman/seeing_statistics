  <h1> Finding the Internet </h1>

	  <p> I drove to the Verizon substation about a mile from my home. It is a brick colonial blending with the architecture in the area except that at the head of the driveway are 2 big “No Trespassing Signs,” which distinguish the 2 story building as a structure and property that are not to be mistaken as a friendly neighbor’s home. In the parking lot, hidden from streetview, were 2 occupied marked police cars. I quickly shuttered my photo, hoping the I landed the shot squarely and sped off. Besides the long shadows on the pavement it’s difficult to tell it’s a beautiful blue-skied day. The long shadows are clues it's late afternoon on a sweltering July afternoon. </p>

	  <p> This substation holds memories for me. Our home often lost Internet and power during inclement weather. One time my mom and I drove to the substation to see if Verizon deployed technicians to help restore our power and Internet during a very cold snowy spell when we had lost power for a full week. Our power and Internet are more reliable these days as Verizon has upgraded their infrastructure in that substation. </p>

	  <p> The photo is of our Verizon cable box attached to our brick house. The junction box is the place where the Verizon cable from the street pole connects to our house, and the central routing point where several different digital TV, phone, and Internet cables fish around our house. They enter the house at multiple points where we have Verizon modems inside. One cable travels up the house to our second story. What you probably can tell is that our Internet is older technology. Now that our whole family is home, and my parents are teleworking we are seriously thinking of upgrading our Internet speed, which will require all rewiring by a Verizon Technician. The box is exposed to the elements. Today it is baking in 90+ degree heat. </p>

	  <p> This photo is the street view of the Internet cable pole (shared with electricity) as well as the wires that hang above our driveway and ultimately hook to our house and down into the junction box. What you may not see is where our Internet and phone wires got spliced by the too high cab of truck that entered our drive. The wires were re-spliced by a Verizon technician and covered by a waterproof “bandaid” that has lasted now for decades. In my neighborhood, the trees don’t respect the wires that hang above ground, and often are the reason we lose Internet and power. The branches are threat when they weigh heavy on the lines. The photo is not a good view of the oddly pruned trees that have their branches cut away in the middle to make way for the lines. </p>
