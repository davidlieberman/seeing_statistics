	  <p> I like the black hole that pierces the brick wall; makes one curious to explore the "deep end." Early animation of snow against the black background makes the black less foreboding. Early example of clickable icons. Cool font that looks 3-dimenensional against the brick wall. </p>

	  <p> Funny title pun after the R package "tidyverse" for datascience. Cool green phosphorescent font on black background; looks like the first gen Apple computer screen; font too small to read and too many tiles with names that are hard to guess what's behind them. Annoying indentations and random underscores. </p>

	  <p> I find this monospace font a bit cramped. However, I appreciate the throw-back to pure ASCII styling, especially with the ASCII art title. It reminds me of the old days of Pong and Telnet Star Wars (20th Century <strike>Fox</strike> *Text). </p>

	  <img src="ryan.png" width=100%/>
	  <p style="text-align:center"> <a href="http://tilde.club/~ryan/"> Source </a> </p>
	  <p> I like the complementary cool colors; the light green and purple are very soothing. Ryan's big blue artsy N symbol with the tilde as a cap (I assume N for Ry-"N") is stark and attention grabbing; makes you want to click on it to learn more about Ry-N. </p>

	  <img src="satoms.png" width=100%/>
	  <p style="text-align:center"> <a href="http://tilde.club/~satoms/"> Source </a> </p>
	  <p> Another example of ASCII art. Too small black font on white background, perhaps a metaphor for what he calls "atoms in the human brain." Headings are too broad: "My life in..." Funny, only one entry for the second heading. Linked pages have interesting titles like "Rare Twits." Daring you to click and find out. </p>

	  <p> Interesting web diary formated as a transluscent box over a photo of a snowy lanscape at dusk. Photo supports some text about bringing wood inside for heat. Nice embedding of links within text. Easy to find white-filled box as header with links to different personal Blog pages. </p>

	  <p style="text-align:center"> <a href="http://tilde.club/~chatsubo/"> Source </a> </p>
	  <p> Simple page-filling logo of large white radiating arrow cardinal rose compass on black background. Artistic and graphic; powerful. Dark and sparse. Except not hot-linked to other pages. Basically a dead page. </p>

	  <img src="jpurnell.png" width=100%/>
	  <p style="text-align:center"> <a href="http://tilde.club/~jpurnell/"> Source </a> </p>
	  <p> Simple but sophisticated webpage; first initial and last name in a dark gray architectural font against a lighter gray background. Links to other blog and twitter pages in a sharp contrasting orange font. Blog page is a vertical list of photographs with narrative. Artistically rendered. </p>

	  <p> Friendly inviting personal title welcoming visitors. Sweet home icon for the homepage. Funny play on words, "netizen" instead of citizen or denizen. Link to a library (in list format) of her personal frequently-visited websites and other information. Temporally interesting â€” date when last updated. Several avenues provided on how to get in touch. </p>

	  <p> Colorful stylized emojis including rock (diamond), paper (toilet paper), and scissors that flash in different sequences next to people. Addicting to watch. Is there a deeper message being imparted? </p>
